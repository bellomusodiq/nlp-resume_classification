# Natural Language Processing for Resume Classification

This is a challenge on Kagle.com which I worked on, I applied 3 diffrent machine learning models, Naive bayes, Decision tree classifier 
and Random forest classifier in which I addopted the Random forest classifier because of it's low variance.
